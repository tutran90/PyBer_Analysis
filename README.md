# **PyBer Analysis**

## **Overview of the Analysis**

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the trends in the rideshare company PyBer between the months of January and April for 3 different types of cities: Urban, Suburban, and rural. 

## **Results**

The following table ![table](https://github.com/tutran90/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Pyber_Data_Summary.png) shows the total number of rides, total number of drivers, total fares, average cost per ride, and average cost the driver makes. 

Out of the three city types. Rural cities had the lowest number of rides (125) and total drivers (78). While urban cities had the highes number of rides (1625) and total number of drivers (2405). 
Having more rides would also explain how urban cities would make more compared to the other two city types (rural & suburban). Urban cities had total fares was $39,854.38. 

What is interesting to see is that rural and suburban drivers actually make more per driver (average fare per rural driver $55.49, average fare per suburban driver $39.50) compared to urban drivers who make only an average of $16.57 per driver. One would think since ridesharing seems to be used more in urban cities, the driver would also make more. 

The following graph ![graph](https://github.com/tutran90/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Total_Fare_By_City_Type.png) gives a better snapshot of how much each city type made per month. Again, we can see that urban cities still made the most compared to rural and suburban cities between January & April. April seemed to be a slow month for urban and suburban cities. Urban cities saw a dramatic drop in fares the beginning of April compared to the other two city types. They started out with roughly $2500 at the beginning of March then dropped to approximately $700 the beginning of April (approximately a 76% decrease). Although rural cities did not make more than $500 during any of those dates, there total fare seemed to stay steady. They did not see a significant drop compared to urban cities. 

## **Summary**
This analysis shows that ridesharing is more popular in the urban areas compared to rural and suburban areas. However, it is quite shocking to see that urban drivers make approximately 70% less than rural drivers (Urban drivers $16.57 and Rural drivers $55.49). If we were to increase the wage for urban drivers this could be an incitive for more drivers to join PyBer. We can already see that it is popular in the Urban areas, so if there are more drivers, theroretically we would make more profit. 

Another thing to look at which was not included in this analysis was the cost per distance. Things are a lot closer in urban areas compared to rural and suburban areas. Which means, an urban driver could be making more trips however they would not be making as much as the rural driver since the rural or suburban driver's one trip could be over 15 miles, and the urban drivers 5 trips was only 10 or 5 miles. This could explain for the average fare per ride for each city being the way it is. It would be good to look at how a user is charge to figure out how to create an equal pay amongst the drivers in different cities. 

If the wage for urban drivers could not be raised, there could be another incentive for drivers. For example, if the driver were to retain certain customers or score more than 4 or 5 stars on an evaluation they could make $1 more for each trip they make that day. This will encourage drivers to provide a better experiece for the customers, which would increase their chances of continuing to use Pyber compared to the other competitors and in the end increase revenue for the company.
